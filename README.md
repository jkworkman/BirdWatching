Name of Project:  Creating Your Second iOS app: Birdwatching

Description of Code: The birdwatching app allows you to add different types of birds to a list.  You click the add button on the master scene.  This allows you to enter name and location information.  Once that is inputed, you select done and the information is added to the list.

One thing I learned: This tutorial introduced me how to set up segue's from scene to scene on the storyboard.  We did a little bit of that in the first tutorial, but this second tutorial really allowed me to understand what all was going on.  I believe I am also becoming more confortable with the syntax of objective-c as well as everything that is going on in xcode after completing this tutorial.
